# Project <br/> Piano Teacher

{: .margBSSmall}
The aim of this project was to create a piano teacher software/hardware that guides
students using lights over the piano keys. I worked on the software part and created a server that handles
the storage of all the midi files. I also built a small music marketplace where users can check available songs,
listen to them and buy the lessons. Backend users were able to add new music files to the database,
while users were able to view, and learn songs they have bought. I also created a prototype piano UI that opens
a midi file and plays it to simulate the hardware itself.

The video below shows an example playing FÃ¼r Elise by Ludwig van Beethoven. The orange keys indicate the next key,
and the green ones currently pressed key. The tempo can be adjusted, and hands/sounds can be toggled in case the
user wants to practise a single hand accompany the melody of the other hand.
