Initially, I wanted to display my Instagram posts on my webpage, however Instagram API only allows non-commercial users to query the 20 most recent posts.

I thought I'd move my images to Flickr, and use them to host my photos, and their API to display the photos on my personal page.

Instagram allows users to download all their data in one zip folder. I wrote this script to go through the folder and upload the Instagram posts to Flickr.

The script also updates location, description and time stamps on Flickr to match Instagram.

After that I used Flickr API to display my photos [here](../photography.html)
