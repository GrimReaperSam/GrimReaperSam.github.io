The aim of this project was to create a piano teacher software/hardware that guides
students using lights over the piano keys. I worked on the software part and created a server that handles
the storage of all the midi files. I also built a small music marketplace where users can check available songs,
listen to them and buy the lessons. Back-end users were able to add new music files to the database,
while users were able to view, and learn songs they have bought. I also created a prototype piano UI that opens
a midi file and plays it to simulate the hardware itself.

The video below shows an example playing FÃ¼r Elise by Ludwig van Beethoven. The orange keys indicate the next key,
and the green ones currently pressed key. The tempo can be adjusted, and hands/sounds can be toggled in case the
user wants to practice a single hand accompany the melody of the other hand.
