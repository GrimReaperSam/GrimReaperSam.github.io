A genetic algorithm (GA) aims at solving optimization problems based on a natural selection process that behaves similarly to biological evolution. The algorithm repeatedly alters a population of individual solutions and randomly selects individuals from the current generation to produce the children for the next generation. This random process leads to the solution after multiple "evolution" rounds.
